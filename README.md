Home Assistant config and lovelace entries need for my personal Sonos view

I do not formally use Github and am not a coder.  The files in the repo are the entries that I used to create the Sonos view as seen below.  I use a custom Google Dark theme so some of your colors may be different.  I have some specific needs that you may not need.  I was never intending this to be for public consumption so I may not be able to answer all questions.  The new core Grid Card could make some of the Lovelace config simpler.  I tried to offer some explanation in each of the files.

Prerequisite Lovelace cards:
  - Decluttering Card (https://github.com/custom-cards/decluttering-card)
  - Stack-in-Card (https://github.com/custom-cards/stack-in-card)
  - Button Card (https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
  - Mini Media Player (https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player)
